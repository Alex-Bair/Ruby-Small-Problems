I love Pokemon. It's my favorite game. Mimikyu is so cute.

However, the dreaded Trick Room Armarouge and Indeedee combo can be devastating in online
competative VGC. Despite the hours of watching Wolfe Glick and Aaron Zheng, I still
do not recognize this tactic in team preview. I only realize what's happening once the first turn commences.

I do like Pokemon stil though.
